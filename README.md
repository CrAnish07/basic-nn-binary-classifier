# Neural Network from Scratch - Insurance Purchase Prediction

This project demonstrates how to build and train a simple neural network **from scratch**, without using any machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch. It uses NumPy and core Python logic to train a binary classifier to predict whether a person buys insurance based on their age and affordability.


## ðŸ”¢ Neural Network Architecture

- Input layer: 2 neurons (`age`, `affordibility`)
- Hidden layer: no hidden layer
- Output layer: 1 neuron (sigmoid activation)

- ### Activation Functions
- Output layer: Sigmoid
